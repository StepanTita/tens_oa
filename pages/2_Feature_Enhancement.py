* We split the genres into separate boolean columns
* We split production companies into separate boolean (top 50) columns, the rest are considered as "other"
* We use ratings and separate Matrix Factorization model to predict ratings, and use it as a feature for the AdaBoost model
* We also find top 5 most similar users based on the cosine similarity of the factorized matrix, and add their ratings for the respective movie as features
