# Recommendation Abstract

## Rationale

* We are using external data to enhance the recommendation system. We are adding movie metadata to the existing data.

* We also use ratings and separate Matrix Factorization model to predict ratings, and use it as a feature for the AdaBoost model.

* We want to predict both based on the similarities of the movies and the users.

* For that we combine 2 models and use the output of the first model as a feature for the second model.

* To do that we use a function "rank_data" that creates the required set of features for the models prediction

* We use AdaBoost as an example of a simple to use and efficient model for the recommendation system.
* We could also use other models like XGBoost, LightGBM, or CatBoost in the real-world scenario.
